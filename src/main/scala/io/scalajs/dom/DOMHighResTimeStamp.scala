/**
  * The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value. The value could be a discrete point in
  * time or the difference in time between two discrete points in time. The unit is milliseconds and should be accurate
  * to 5 Âµs (microseconds). However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds
  * (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent the value as a time in milliseconds
  * accurate to a millisecond.
