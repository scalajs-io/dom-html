  * The Attr interface inherits from Node and represents a single attribute of an Element node.

  * However the Attr interface is a special case in terms of inheritance â€” attribute nodes are not child nodes of
  * the element they belong to, and have no parent or sibling nodes, so although inherited Node properties such as
  * parentNode and nextSibling are available, they always return null. Attributes are considered by the DOM to be
  * properties of elements, rather than objects in their own right.
